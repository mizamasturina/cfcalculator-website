			<h1>The Carbon Footprint</h1>
			<h2>Awareness is the key!</h2>
			<p>Awareness about carbon footprint is critical because it helps individuals and organizations understand the environmental impact of their daily activities, as well as the broader impact on climate change. By being aware of our carbon footprint, we can take steps to reduce it, such as using renewable energy, reducing energy consumption, choosing sustainable transportation options, and making lifestyle changes to reduce emissions. This can help promote sustainable development, mitigate climate change, and create a better future for ourselves and future generations.</p>
			<br><br> <h1>What is Carbon Footprint?</h1>
			<p>A carbon footprint is a "certain amount of gaseous emissions that are relevant to climate change and associated with human production or consumption activities"</p>

						   <h2>Sources of Carbon Footprint</h2>
					 		<p>The carbon footprint of an individual is a measure of the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that result from their daily activities and lifestyle choices. This includes both direct and indirect emissions, such as those from transportation, housing, food consumption, and other activities. </p>
						 <div class="source">
							 <img src="elec waste.jpg" alt="Service 1" class="picture">
							 <h3>Electricity</h3>
							 <p> CO2 emissions are emitted from generation through the combustion of fossil fuels to generate heat needed to power steam turbines</p>
						 </div>
						 <div class="source">
							 <img src="food waste.jpg" alt="Service 2"class="picture" >
							 <h3>Food</h3>
							 <p>Food's carbon footprint, or foodprint, is the greenhouse gas emissions produced by growing, rearing, farming, processing, transporting, storing, cooking and disposing of the food you eat.</p>
						 </div>
						 <div class="kanan">
							 <img src="transport waste.jpg" alt="Service 3" class="picture right">
							 <h3>Transportation</h3>
							 <p>Burning fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere.</p>
						 </div>
						 <div class="kanan">
							 <img src="water waste.jpg" alt="Service 4"  class="picture right">
							 <h3>Water</h3>
							 <p>Water can add to carbon footprint due to the energy needed for treatment, transportation, and distribution, and the production of bottled water.</p>

						   <h2>Impacts of Carbon Footprint</h2>
					 		<p>The carbon footprint of an individual is a measure of the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that result from their daily activities and lifestyle choices.

							 <h3>Climate change</h3>
							 <p> The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can lead to changes in global temperature, weather patterns, sea level rise, and other environmental impacts, which can have widespread and long-lasting effects on ecosystems, wildlife, and human populations.</p>
						 </div>
						 <div class="impact">
							 <img src="health.jpg" alt="Service 2" >
							 <h3>Health impacts</h3>
							 <p>Air pollution resulting from carbon emissions can have negative impacts on human health, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular health, leading to increased rates of illness, hospitalizations, and mortality</p>
						 </div>
						 <div class="impact">
							 <img src="economy.png" alt="Service 3" >
							 <h3>Economic impacts</h3>
							 <p>The costs of climate change and carbon mitigation measures can be significant, affecting industries and economies around the world, particularly in vulnerable and low-income regions.</p>
						 </div>
						 <div class="impact">
							 <img src="social.jpg" alt="Service 4" >
							 <h3>Social impacts</h3>
							 <p>Climate change and its impacts can also exacerbate social inequalities, particularly for marginalized and vulnerable communities, and may lead to forced migration, conflicts, and displacement.</p>
						 </div>					 
						 <div class="impact">
							 <img src="ecosystem.jpg" alt="Service 5" >
							 <h3>Ecosystem impacts</h3>
							 <p>Changes in global temperature and weather patterns can have significant impacts on ecosystems, including changes in plant and animal populations, habitat loss, and altered nutrient cycles.</p>
						 </div>

						 <div class="impact">
							<img src="bio.jpg" alt="Service 6" >
							<h3>Biodiversity Loss</h3>
							<p>Climate change caused by carbon emissions can lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, which can have a detrimental impact on plant and animal species. This can lead to biodiversity loss and even extinction.</p>
